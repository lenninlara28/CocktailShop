# React Project with Vite

This is a React project bootstrapped using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast and modern build tool.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher recommended)
- **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm** (depending on your preferred package manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install dependencies


Using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

To run the development server, use:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Open the app in your browser

After starting the server, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```
