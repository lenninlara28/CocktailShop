# React Project with Vite

This is a React project bootstrapped using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast and modern build tool.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher recommended)
- **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm** (depending on your preferred package manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

Using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

To run the development server, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

or

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Open the app in your browser

After starting the server, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

### 5. Build for production

To create a production-ready build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

or

```bash
pnpm build
```

The output will be in the `dist` folder.

### 6. Preview the production build

To preview the production build locally, run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

or

```bash
yarn preview
```

or

```bash
pnpm preview
```
